# GPT-Over-API

GPT-Over-API is a lightweight client for OpenAI's GPT language model, which uses a cost-effective API to eliminate the risk of API token leaks. The client can be easily run from an HTML file in your browser and has no third-party dependencies, making it a simple and secure solution for interacting with GPT.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GPT-Over-API chat client, simply download the `index.html` file to your computer and open it in your web browser. Once the page loads, you will need to provide your API token to begin using the chat client. If you do not have an API token yet, it can easily be generated on the OpenAI website using link provided in the app.

## Demo

Check out our live demo to see GPT-Over-API in action!

Note: For security reasons, you may want to use the downloaded version of the client rather than the live demo to avoid any potential leaks to GitHub.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving GPT-Over-API! This is a very early and basic version of the client, and there is much room for improvement. If you have ideas for new features or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can make GPT more accessible and useful for everyone.
